This is an improvised Tasks system, because I needed something more powerful than just plane TODOs in the Source Code of my projects, yet I didn't want to install a full blown Issue Tracker System.

## The Spec

### Layout

Each project at the root has `tasks/` folder which contains sub-folders for each task.

```
project/
+-...
+-tasks/
| +-tags
| +-20260824-215300
| | +-TASK.md
| | +-...
| +-20260830-000403-rexim
| | +-TASK.md
| | +-screenshot.png
| | +-...
| +-...
+-...
```

### HUID

Each task sub-folder is named with a Task ID. The Task ID format is `[0-9]{8}-[0-9]{6}`. Just grab the current date and time and use it as the Task ID. Use UTC timezone so the current timezone is irrelevant. If your Task ID collides with an existing one, just wait one second and try again.

The full format is actually `[0-9]{8}-[0-9]{6}(-[a-zA-Z0-9\\-]*)?`. So if you work in a team you can agree on unique suffixes per individual to slap at the end like `20260829-235855-rexim` or `20260829-235902-01`. Those are valid Task IDs too.

I call this ID system HUID (Human-Unique IDentifier). It is fairly unique if you generate IDs at "Human-speed". That is for me personally the speed at which I need to generate them is never below one second.

Having a Unique Task ID is beneficial under such control systems as git, because you can generate tasks in parallel branches and then relatively easily merge them together.

### TASK.md

Inside of the task sub-folder there is one mandatory file `TASK.md` which is a markdown file describing the task. The folder may contain other files as attachments to the task. `TASK.md` should link to the attachments as necessary. Try to keep the size of the attachments small, since they are going to be committed to the git repo. Use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to reencode any screencast to reduce their size as necessary.

The format of `TASK.md`:

```markdown
# <title>

- STATUS: (OPEN|CLOSED)
- PRIORITY: <number>
- TAGS: <comma-and-whitespace-separated-list-of-tags>
[other properties]

[description]
```

As you work on the task feel free to append any discovered details about the task to the `[description]`.

Use [git-blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame) and [git-log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) to learn about when, how and by whom any changes to the task were made.

#### Task Properties

The `STATUS` property defines whether the task is done or not. There could be only two statuses. If you need more it is generally recommended to use `TAGS` for whatever you are trying to do.

The `PRIORITY` is generally used for sorting the tasks by the external tools. One thing I've seen people online do is stressing out about what priority to put. Don't think of priority as an absolute value. Think of it as the means of getting your list of tasks sorted in a specific way you want them to see.

The `TAGS` property contains the list of tags separated by commas and whitespaces. `TAGS: foo,bar,baz` defines 3 tags. `TAGS: foo,,, hello  world` also defines 3 tags. You can use these tags to group tasks into categories. Like `bug` or `enhancement`.

We allow to specify `[other properties]` (in addition to `STATUS`, `PRIORITY`, and `TAGS`) in a similar format (that is `- [NAME]: [VALUE]`), the official tool will ignore them but try its best to not disturb them too much during any mass update operations (like `tatr-untag`, etc).

Duplicated properties are not allowed. If a tasks specifies duplicated properties only the last value must be taken into account. Mass update operations of the official tool will remove any duplicated properties.

### Tags description file

There might be an optional `tasks/tags` file with the following format:

```
<tag-name> [,] <tag-description>
<tag-name> [,] <tag-description>
<tag-name> [,] <tag-description>
...
```

It serves as a documentation for each existing tag and the thirdparty tools may use it to display the tag descriptions.

## The Tool

The repo comes with a command line tool that helps to navigate and manipulate the `tasks/` folder:

```console
$ cc -o nob nob.c
$ ./nob
$ sudo cp ./build/tatr /usr/local/bin/
$ tatr help
```

It is optimized for Emacs compilation mode, but its `path:line:message` task reports also work with Vim and Neovim's built-in quickfix list (see below).

We only support Linux right now But I have tasks to add [Windows](./tasks/20260825-170729/TASK.md) and [MacOS](./tasks/20260901-063204/TASK.md) support in the future.

You are welcome to make your own tools.

### Vim / Neovim

#### Project-local Neovim setup

Requires Neovim 0.9+ with its project-config trust mechanism. First enable project-local configuration in your own Neovim config (normally `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`):

```lua
vim.o.exrc = true
```

Then, with `tatr`, `git`, and `nvim` on `PATH`, run from the **target Git project's root**:

```sh
tatr nvim-setup
```

This first verifies the current directory is a Git worktree root, then checks Neovim's effective `exrc` setting, copies the bundled [configuration](./contrib/nvim/tatr.lua) to `.nvim.lua`, and adds `/.nvim.lua` to `.gitignore`. It reports each step. The check starts headless Neovim with your user configuration from `/`, outside the project; your configuration and plugins still execute. If Neovim is missing, reports startup errors, or has `exrc` disabled, setup stops before writing project files and asks you to fix your configuration yourself. It never edits your user config or approves trust for you.

Review `.nvim.lua`, then open Neovim from the project and approve its trust prompt. Use:

| Action | Command / key |
| --- | --- |
| List open tasks | `:Tasks` or `<leader>tt` |
| Create a task | `:Tasks new [-t tag] [-p N] Title...`, then the list refreshes |
| Filter tasks | `:Tasks :bug and priority lt 50` |
| List closed tasks | `:Tasks -c` |
| Open a listed task | Enter in quickfix |
| Next / previous task | `:cnext` / `:cprevious` |
| Browse the task's folder in a split | `:Tasks explore` or `<leader>td` (netrw's `:Explore`, or [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim); from the task list it follows the entry under the cursor) |

The command and mappings are registered only if `tatr` is executable. If it isn't on `PATH`, edit the executable path in `.nvim.lua`. Task rows print paths relative to the directory `tatr` runs from; the script normalizes the redundant `./` prefix so rows render uniformly, and keeps `../` when Neovim runs in a subdirectory. Your normal build settings are untouched. This configuration lasts for the Neovim session; changing directories does not unload it. Use one instance per project.

Both setup commands require Git on `PATH` and must run at a Git worktree root (including linked worktrees). They reject subdirectories, non-Git folders, and bare repositories before probing Neovim or writing files. They never initialize Git or automatically move to a parent directory.

Setup is idempotent: rerunning it with identical installed files succeeds without rewriting them or duplicating ignore entries. Differing existing files are preserved and reported as conflicts. To customize or update an existing installation, review/merge the template manually or move your file aside before rerunning setup. Ignore entries do not untrack files already committed to Git. Neither setup command creates a task database; use `tatr init` separately if needed.

#### Manual setup for Vim or Neovim

No plugin is needed. With `tatr` on your `PATH`, run these commands inside Vim or Neovim from your project directory (or any subdirectory):

```vim
:set makeprg=tatr
:set errorformat=%f:%l:%m
:make! ls
:copen
```

Press Enter on a quickfix entry to open its `TASK.md`. Use `:cnext` / `:cprevious` to navigate. `:make!` fills quickfix without jumping to the first entry.

The same setup works with queries and other commands:

```vim
:make! ls :bug and priority lt 50
:make! ls -c
:make! new -t bug Fix the parser
:make! find 20260829-235855-rexim
:make! ref 20260829-235855-rexim
```

Replace the example IDs with your own. Edit and save `TASK.md` normally to change its description, status, priority, or tags, then rerun `:make! ls` to refresh the list. Save changes before running commands that modify tasks, such as `untag`.

These settings replace your normal `:make` command and output parser for the session; they are not required in your editor config. Informational output (such as "No tasks were found") remains visible in quickfix but is not a jump target. `summary` and `untag` do not produce per-task locations.

### Agent skill

[skills/tatr/SKILL.md](./skills/tatr/SKILL.md) teaches an agent the CLI commands, TQL syntax, task format, and safe human-agent task maintenance workflow. It is reusable in other projects; the agent should work in the target project's directory, using a trusted `tatr` executable on `PATH` or an explicitly supplied absolute path.

Install a project-local copy from the **target Git project's root** (Git must be on `PATH`):

```sh
tatr skill-setup
```

This creates `.agents/skills/tatr/SKILL.md` from the bundled skill and adds `/.agents/skills` to `.gitignore`, reporting what it changes or leaves unchanged. It preserves other skills and refuses to overwrite a differing existing tatr skill. Neovim and `exrc` are **not** required for this command. Setup refuses linked/special destination paths and does not stage, commit, or push anything. Run either setup command without concurrent filesystem writers; review any partially completed changes if an I/O error occurs.

Start a new Pi session in that project and use `/skill:tatr`, or ask the agent to maintain its tasks. Pi discovers project-local skills after the project is trusted. Other Agent Skills-compatible tools must support the `.agents/skills/` location.

Alternatively, for a global Pi installation, run from this source checkout's root (the destination must not already exist):

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills/tatr" ~/.agents/skills/tatr
```

Keep this checkout in place while using the global symlink. Choose one installation scope to avoid duplicate skill names in Pi. For other Agent Skills-compatible tools, use their documented skill location.

### Tatr Query Language (TQL)

The Query language that is used in `tatr ls` command to select a set of tasks.

#### Examples

Query everything with tag `bug`:

```console
$ tatr ls :bug
```

Everything with tag `bug`, but without tag `ui`:

```console
$ tatr ls :bug and not :ui
```

Everything that is not tagged:

```console
$ tatr ls not tagged
```

All the bugs with priority less than 50:

```console
$ tatr ls :bug and priority lt 50
```

#### Syntax

Here is the [Backus–Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) of the language:

```
<expr>            ::= <or>
<or>              ::= <and> *('or' <and>)
<and>             ::= <compare> *('and' <compare>)
<compare>         ::= <primary> *(<compare-op> <primary>)
<compare-op>      ::= 'lt' | 'le' | 'gt' | 'ge' | 'eq' | 'ne'
<primary>         ::= <tag>
                    | '[' <expr> ']'
                    | 'not' <primary>
                    | 'any'
                    | 'tagged'
                    | 'priority'
                    | <number>
                    | <huid>
<tag>             ::= ':' 1*<any-character-except-whitespaces-and-square-brackets>
<number>          ::= ['-'] 1*<digit>
<huid>            ::= 8<digit> '-' 6<digit> [ '-' [ <huid-suffix> ] ]
<huid-suffix>     ::= 'A'-'Z' | 'a'-'z' | '-' | <digit>
<digit>           ::= '0'-'9'
```

The syntax is designed to be used in shell environment without requiring any special escaping.

In shells parenthsis usually have special meaning. Because of that we use square brackets for grouping expressions `'[' <expr> ']'`.

Another problematic symbols are `<` and `>`, which are usually used for file redirecting. Which means we can't easily use traditional comparison operators. So we are following the [test(1)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/test.1.html) utility convention: `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`, `eq`, and `ne`.

Since brackets have a special meaning in TQL, if you have any tags that contain them, you probably won't be able to filter by them (even though the specs do not explicitly prohibit square brackets in the tags). Just don't use square brackets in the tags if you are using `tatr` I guess. I may do something about that later.
